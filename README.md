# Multi Pivot Quicksort

<img src="documentation/png/dualpivot.png" width="750">

QuickSort is perhaps the most commonly used sorting algorithm. It works with all types of data and is generally the fastest method, especially for large inputs. QuickSort is the primary sorting algorithm in many programming environments, such as Java and C++.

In the past ten years, new developments in QuickSort have further improved its efficiency. Multi-pivot sorting algorithms are already widely used, but even better algorithms are still being developed.

This study examines different QuickSort algorithms and how their efficiency depends on various factors. When evaluating efficiency, it is also important to consider how well the algorithm utilizes the computerâ€™s resources. The efficiency improvements in multi-pivot QuickSort algorithms have been shown to result mainly from better cache utilization rather than increased algorithm speed.

Empirical tests were conducted in this study using different QuickSort methods. The test results align with the published theoretical and experimental results of various methods. Theoretical analysis indicates that the optimal number of pivots is four or five. The number of pivots is limited by the difficulty of selecting optimal pivot elements.

The empirical tests were coded using C++ programming language version C++11.
